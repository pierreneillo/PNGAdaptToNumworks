<h1> PNG Adapt to Numworks</h1>
PNG decompiler, to import as an external app on the Numworks calculator

<h2>Composition</h2>
This project shall be written in two parts:
 - The first part is the program for the pre-treatment of the image to import : optimization of the colors, given the screen of the Numworks calculator displays only 32768 colors (32 red, 32 green and 32 blue). This part shall contain a compliant PNG decompiler and a compiler which compiles with a smaller buffer than authorised, because the Numworks calculator does not have a big memory. The output image will therefore be not as well compressed as the original one perhaps, but will be readable by the Numworks calculator.
 - The second part should contain an adapted decompiler, an a program for image displaying.
